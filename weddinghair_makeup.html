            <div class="services-list">
              <p>Bookings: Your appointment date(s) and service(s) will be secured when the signed contract and a NON-REFUNDABLE deposit of $100.00 or other is received. Deposit amount is determined by the artist, and is based on the total quote or package price. All
              bookings for Weddings are made on a first-come-first-served basis. No dates will be guaranteed without a signed contract and deposit. We recommend all deposits be paid on the day of the trial to guarantee your bookings. Remaining balance is
              due the day of the wedding after services begin. Prices are subject to change as styling needs change, services are added, or travel distance change. Prices do not include gratuity. We accept cash or Venmo transfer at this time.</p>
              <p>Travel/travel fee: The travel rate is $0.50 per mile to and from event location starting from 95008 and/or a minimum of $40. All costs for travel for booked event are to be paid by client. Costs may include but are not limited to: airfare, hotels,
              transportation, and parking. If the booked event is more than an hour and a half from 95008 and requires Artist(s) to start services by and before 7AM, client must provide hotel accommodation.</p>
              <p>Payments: The final balance is due on the day of the event before or after each services are performed. Acceptable forms of payment are: Cash or Venmo transfer. Checks and credit/debit cards are currently not accepted. Gratuity is welcomed.</p>
              <p>Cancellations: This contract states that Caroline Kan will be providing you with the contracted services. If any cancellations are made after 14 days of the contracted services, the full amount must still be paid. Clients are to be ready for their services
              at the time provided on this contract or schedule. Caroline Kan will not be held responsible for clients who are late for their alloted service time.</p>
